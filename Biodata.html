<h1>My Biodata</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Nur Shahida Binti Zulkepli, I am 21 years old I live in Gua Musang, Kelantan. I was born in Hospital Besar Kota Bharu. I have three siblings and I was number two. Now I’m doing my didploma's in the University Technology Mara (UITM) Campus Machang, Kelantan and Diploma in Information Management. Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Cooking is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax because after we are cooking we can enjoy the food with our own recipe. While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be a traveler. I don’t remember when I fell in love with traveling, but over the years, my passion for traveling has increased. Over the past few months, I have started living this dream, and it gives me so much joy. When I see the beautiful view of the nature, it make me feel very peaceful.
